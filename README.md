# CineMatch README

## Team Info
- **Team Name:** CineMatch
  
**Team Policies:**  

  *Absence Policy:* 
    We are following the regular class syllabus, so for every 3 unexcused absences, the grade level would be down by 1. Second, we would gather the reasoning behind the absence, and will catch the person up. For weekly meeting absences will be graded as 0 for those weeks unless there’s a valid reason.    

  *Ethic Policy:*
    Ensure all members understand the consequences of unethical actions. The consequences would lead to affecting the team and the overall project as a whole and as such, each team member is held to a higher standard, and would be held accountable for any mistakes such as deleting code or performing unethical actions.

  *Language Policy:*  
    We will use primarily English and we should keep it respectful.  

  *Code/Work Modification Guidelines:*  
    Ask for permission or let it be known if working on another member’s code or work. If the owner of code does not respond within an hour or so, whoever is working on the code can create a new branch using the owner's existing code and add onto it. 

  *Performance Requirement:*  
    B- or higher: Fulfill your role, show up, and communicate. Basically, commit regularly, finish your assigned tasks, if not, you would communicate it within a reasonable time frame to let the team know that you may need some assistance. Show up to meetings, as well as talk to team members about your progress and overall, do a fair share of the work that is required.

  *Communication Standards:*  
    We will set up Discord, an email thread, Trello, and a group Google Drive for coordination. Possibly a Scrum sheet as well. Expected timeline for reply is 24 hours

## Project Description
Takes a user's search input (actor, director, and genre) to find a suggested match closest to the user's selected option using a point system. Possible functionality include: using current logged in account to see what movies closely resemble to already watched movies, as well as using some kind of neural network or artifical intelligence to have further functionalities but that's optional by our standards.

## Team Member Bios

### Yousif Shkara: 
Hello, my name is Yousif Shkara, a senior at EMU, majoring in Computer Science Curriculum. I have done many projects CS-related and not. Including, making servers, building computers, building applications and websites that are incorporated in my daily life, making things a lot easier and saving time. In my work experience, I have led an IT team going into hospitals in Detroit Metro area, into every room including Operation Rooms, Emergency, Compounding rooms, etc, if there exists a room in a hospital with computers there's a good chance my team and I been there. I also have trained some onsite support in the biggest hospital in Michigan about Epic (popular medical software) about mapping and troubleshooting issues that may arise. I know the following: HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, Python, Java, C#, C, C++, SQL, and Ruby. I also have experience in learning Operating Systems and software very quickly. If there's anything in my life that can be improved via computer science or IT, then I would possibly pursue it, and I never turn down learning opportunities. Things I love doing on the side when I'm not working are hanging out with friends and gaming. I'm very excited for this project!

### Jacob Henderson:
My Name is Jacob Henderson, I am Computer Science major. I have experience working with Java, and Python. This project interest me due to my love for movies and a lack of websites that suggest movies. Outside of school I currently work at a PGA Superstore, some of my main hobbies are fishing, hunting and golfing as much as i can as long as the weather allows. I;m looking foward to working with the team and getting to learn more about eachother as the semester goes on, as well as taking this project from just an idea to a fully function website that other could use.

### Eric Eggleston:
My name is Eric Eggleston. I am a computer science Bachelor of Arts major and I have experience with Java, C++, and Kotlin . The last project that I worked on was a mobile app using Kotlin in Android Studio that created a bucket list for locations around cities. Outside of school, I enjoy gaming and playing sports.

### Caleb Bujauskas: 
Hello, I am Caleb. Currently enrolled in the Bachelor of Arts Computer Science program as a senior at EMU. I have experience with various programming languages such as java, python, and C. Most of my programming experience has been with backend-development, recently I have worked on an astroids game using pygame. Outside of school I work at DTW Metro Airport as a ramp agent where I load/offload luggage to and from aircraft. In my free time I enjoy playing mediocre guitar, gaming on Battlefield, and most importantly spending time with my beautiful Fiancée and our two bad but very cute cats.

### Andrew Higgin:   
Hey, I'm Andrew, and I'm a computer science major at EMU, with a minor in S.A.G. (simulation, animation, and gaming). I'm also the president of the university's game development club, so I have lots of experience in Unity/C#, but I have also used Unreal Engine and Godot. I also like tinkering with Arduino. My dream is to work at Toyota, and I'm teaching myself MATLAB and Simulink. I currently work at theCoderSchool in Plymouth, helping kids learn to code in a variety of languages. I chose to work on this project specifically because I love movies, and this would actually be a service I'd use to find good movies. I spend lots of time (and storage) creating perfect remuxes of my favorite movies to watch in my dream home theater setup later in life. My girlfriend and I also love to go hiking and eventually hunting all over Michigan together. While I grew up in California, right outside LA, for the first 12 years of my life, I plan on staying here in Michigan.

### Owen O’Brien:  
Owen is a Data Science and Analytics major at Eastern Michigan University skilled in Python, Java, SQL, and R, with additional experience in data visualization and tools such as Microsoft SQL, Power BI, AWS, and RStudio. For a database project, he created a hotel reservation system using Microsoft SQL, Power BI, and WinSCP, which allowed users to make hotel reservations through a cloud-hosted website. He has also completed coursework in big data management and data warehousing.
