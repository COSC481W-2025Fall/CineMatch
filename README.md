Hello, my name is Yousif Shkara, a senior at EMU, majoring in Computer Science Curriculum. I have done many projects CS-related and not. Including, making servers, building computers, building applications and websites that are incorporated in my daily life, making things a lot easier and saving time. In my work experience, I have led an IT team going into hospitals in Detroit Metro area, into every room including Operation Rooms, Emergency, Compounding rooms, etc, if there exists a room in a hospital with computers there's a good chance my team and I been there. I also have trained some onsite support in the biggest hospital in Michigan about Epic (popular medical software) about mapping and troubleshooting issues that may arise. I know the following: HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, Python, Java, C#, C, C++, SQL, and Ruby. I also have experience in learning Operating Systems and software very quickly. If there's anything in my life that can be improved via computer science or IT, then I would possibly pursue it, and I never turn down learning opportunities. Things I love doing on the side when I'm not working are hanging out with friends and gaming. I'm very excited for this project!
