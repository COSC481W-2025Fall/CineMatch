## Project Description
Takes a user's search input (actor, director, and genre) to find a suggested match closest to the user's selected option using a point system. Possible functionality include: using current logged in account to see what movies closely resemble to already watched movies, as well as using some kind of neural network or artifical intelligence to have further functionalities but that's optional by our standards.
